started w/ rosbag from cwruBot of kinect/depth/points

Code process_pcl.cpp does:
*subscribe to topic /kinect/depth/points
*also subscribes to /selected_points
*computes normals of selected patches of points.

*run roscore
*run: rosrun example_pcl process_pcl 

*start up rviz.  Set fixed frame to kinect frame: kinect_pc_frame, and add pointCloud2, w/ topic kinect/depth/points

*do: rosbag play 2015-03-18-15-52-42.bag (using example recorded file 2015-03-18-15-52-42.bag )

view shows up in rviz.  

in rviz, click on "published selected points"

process_pcl will compute centroid and normal of selected patch

--next:
  select 3 patches, define plane, transform points to frame of plane, filter points to keep only pts
   w/|z| < Z_TOL
