# minimal_nodes

This package contains demo source files, including: a minimal publisher example, and a complementary minimal subscriber.

Also, a minimal simulator (much, much simpler than Gazebo) and a minimal controller (which work together).

## Example usage
`rosrun minimal_nodes example_publisher`
In a separate terminal:
`rosrun minimal_nodes minimal_subscriber`

To run the minimal simulator demo, 
`rosrun minimal_nodes minimal_simulator`
In a separate terminal:
`rosrun minimal_nodes minimal_controller`

See the notes "Intro to ROS v3" for detailed explanation and use of these.
