This folder contains modified Baxter world, modified Baxter URDF (w/ Kinect),
and two launch files to facilitate Baxter demo.

The launch files here refer to the cwru-modified baxter.urdf, formerly found in:
~/ros_ws/src/rethink/baxter_common/baxter_description/urdf

In first window, run:
(optirun) `roslaunch cwru_baxter_sim baxter_world.launch`

wait for "gravity compensation was turned off"

In second terminal, run:
`roslaunch cwru_baxter_sim cwru_baxter_sim.launch` 

In third terminal,
`roscd simple_gui`
`./service_call_gui`

FOR PHYSICAL BAXTER ONLY:

To use Yale hand, (in 4th terminal):
`roslaunch motor_controller yale_hand.launch`

If race condition, then do the above via separate launches:
`roslaunch motor_controller controller_manager.launch`
(wait) and
`roslaunch motor_controller tilt_controller.launch`
(runs to completion)
