## Modern Robotic Programming, Fall 2015
Welcome to Modern Robotic Programming!  This repository will contain all class-specific software, documentation,
and will also function as a help center for students.

#### Wiki
For a continually evolving set of information about the class, please refer to the Wiki which can be access on the sidebar 
to the right.

#### Git Help
This course will heavily rely on the use of Github and Git in general.  If you are not comfortable with forking, cloning, branching, pushing, pulling, merging, and pull-requesting, you should definitely read up on them and practice how they're done.

#### Student Help / Issues
If you have a question about an assignment that is not pressing, please open up an issue on this repository 
(<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/">How-To</a>).  This will allow the instructor, TA, and perhaps
other students to assist you in a public setting.  If the issue is pressing and there has been no response, you may send an email.
